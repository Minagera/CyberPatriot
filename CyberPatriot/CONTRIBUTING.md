# Contributing to the Grissom HS JROTC CyberPatriot Repository

Thank you for considering contributing to our CyberPatriot training resources! Your input helps keep our materials relevant, effective, and unique.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Reporting Issues:** If you find errors, outdated information, or areas for improvement, please open an issue on the GitHub repository detailing the problem.
2.  **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new guide, exercise, script, or checklist item? Open an issue to discuss it first.
3.  **Submitting Changes (Pull Requests):**
    *   Fork the repository.
    *   Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`).
    *   Make your changes. Ensure they adhere to the guidelines below.
    *   Test your changes thoroughly (e.g., run scripts, verify exercise steps).
    *   Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
    *   Push your branch to your fork.
    *   Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.
    *   Clearly describe the changes made and the reasoning behind them in the pull request description.

## Contribution Guidelines

*   **Uniqueness:** All contributed content (text, scripts, scenarios) **must be original work** or clearly derived from permissible sources with proper attribution, and significantly adapted for CyberPatriot training needs. Do **not** copy content directly from copyrighted sources or existing public CyberPatriot solutions. Our goal is unique training material.
*   **Relevance:** Contributions should be directly applicable to the CyberPatriot competition (Windows, Linux, Cisco, strategy, forensics) and suitable for high school cadets aiming for Nationals.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure technical information, commands, and procedures are correct and up-to-date.
*   **Clarity:** Write clearly and concisely. Use formatting (Markdown) effectively. Comment scripts well.
*   **Structure:** Follow the existing directory structure and file naming conventions. Place new files in the appropriate directories.
*   **Testing:** Scripts should be tested on relevant OS versions (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 10/11). Exercises should be tested to ensure they are solvable and the instructions are clear.
*   **README Updates:** If adding new files or directories, update relevant `README.md` files (e.g., the main README, directory READMEs) to include links and descriptions.
*   **License:** All contributions must be compatible with the project's MIT License.

## Areas for Contribution

*   **Guides:** Expanding existing guides (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) or adding new ones on specific tools or techniques.
*   **Exercises:** Creating new hands-on exercises or scenarios (Windows, Linux, Cisco, Cross-Platform).
*   **Scripts:** Developing new audit scripts (PowerShell, Bash) or configuration snippets (Cisco). Ensure scripts prioritize information gathering or safe, reversible changes suitable for training.
*   **Checklists:** Refining existing checklists or adding new checks based on recent competition trends (always emphasizing the competition README first).
*   **Quizzes:** Adding new questions or full quizzes (with solutions for mentors).
*   **VM-Setup:** Improving existing VM/Packet Tracer setup scripts/scenarios or creating new ones with different themes or vulnerabilities.
*   **Templates:** Creating or improving documentation templates (Change Logs, Incident Reports, etc.).

We appreciate your help in making this a valuable resource for Grissom CyberPatriot cadets!
