# Mock Competition Exercise

## Scenario

You are given Windows, Linux, and Cisco Packet Tracer images with multiple vulnerabilities and a README with forensics questions. Your team must secure all systems, answer forensics, and maximize your score within the time limit.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate teamwork and communication under competition conditions.
- Apply security checklists to Windows, Linux, and Cisco systems.
- Identify and remediate vulnerabilities unique to each platform.
- Complete all forensics and documentation requirements.

## Tasks

1. **Assign Team Roles**
   - Document each member's responsibilities (Windows, Linux, Cisco, Documentation, Forensics, etc.).
2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Read all README and scenario instructions.
   - Identify high-value targets and prioritize tasks.
3. **System Hardening**
   - Windows: Secure user accounts, apply updates, configure Defender, harden services, review policies.
   - Linux: Remove unauthorized users, set password policies, update system, configure firewall, secure services.
   - Cisco: Secure device access, configure VLANs, apply ACLs, disable unused ports, enable logging.
4. **Forensics**
   - Answer all forensics questions provided in the scenario README.
   - Document evidence and remediation steps.
5. **Documentation**
   - Use provided templates to log all changes.
   - Track points for each completed task.
   - Maintain a timeline of actions.
6. **Final Review**
   - Double-check all systems for missed vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure all documentation is complete.
   - Submit a final report with:
     - Team roles
     - Change log
     - Forensics answers
     - Lessons learned

## Scoring

- Each correctly remediated vulnerability: 1â€“5 points (based on difficulty)
- Each forensics question answered correctly: 5 points
- Complete and clear documentation: up to 10 bonus points
- Teamwork and communication (mentor evaluation): up to 5 bonus points

## Hints

- Use all checklists and templates provided.
- Communicate regularly with your team.
- Assign a documentation lead to ensure nothing is missed.
- Prioritize high-value and high-impact vulnerabilities first.
- Leave time for a final review before submission.
