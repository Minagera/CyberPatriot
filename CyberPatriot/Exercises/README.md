# CyberPatriot Exercises Directory

This directory is the central hub for hands-on exercises and challenge scenarios for CyberPatriot training.
It covers all three core competition areas: Windows, Linux, and Cisco Packet Tracer, plus cross-platform challenges.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the subdirectory for the desired platform (Windows, Linux, Cisco) or select a cross-platform challenge.
2.  Read the `README.md` in the subdirectory for exercise descriptions.
3.  Select an exercise `.md` file.
4.  Prepare the required environment (VM, Packet Tracer file). VM setup scripts and Packet Tracer files can often be found in the `../VM-Setup/` or `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/` directories respectively.
5.  Follow the instructions in the exercise file.
6.  Use the `../Guides/` and `../Checklists/` directories for reference.

## VM Setup Scripts

Many exercises correspond to VM images created using scripts in the `../VM-Setup/` directory. Ensure you have generated the appropriate VM before starting exercises that require them.

## Additional Notes

-   All exercises and scripts are unique and designed for CyberPatriot training.
-   If any referenced file is missing, create a placeholder or template to ensure a complete experience.
-   For any new exercise, follow the established format: scenario, objectives, tasks, scoring (optional), hints, and solution reference (optional).
