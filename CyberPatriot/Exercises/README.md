# CyberPatriot Exercises Directory

This directory is the central hub for hands-on exercises and challenge scenarios for CyberPatriot training. It covers all three core competition areas: Windows, Linux, and Cisco Packet Tracer, plus cross-platform challenges.

## Directory Structure

-   [**Windows/**](Windows/README.md): Exercises focused on securing Windows systems (user accounts, policies, services, firewall, forensics).
-   [**Linux/**](Linux/README.md): Exercises focused on securing Linux systems (users, permissions, services, UFW, SSH, forensics).
-   [**Cisco/**](Cisco/README.md): Exercises involving Cisco IOS configuration via Packet Tracer (basic hardening, ACLs, SSH, VLANs). Includes links to `.pkt` files in `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/`.
-   [**Cross-Platform/**](Cross-Platform/README.md): Exercises that may involve interactions between different operating systems or concepts applicable to multiple platforms (e.g., network scanning, basic incident response).

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the relevant platform subdirectory.
2.  Read the `README.md` within that subdirectory for a list of available exercises.
3.  Follow the instructions within each exercise's markdown file.
4.  Use practice VMs created via `../VM-Setup/` scripts or clean VMs as specified by the exercise.
5.  For Cisco exercises, use Packet Tracer and the corresponding `.pkt` files.
6.  Attempt the exercises individually or as a team.
7.  Compare your solutions/findings with any provided solution guides (mentors may hold these).

## VM Setup Scripts

Many exercises assume a starting point provided by the VM setup scripts in the `../VM-Setup/` directory. Ensure you have created snapshots of the initial compromised state generated by these scripts:
-   `../VM-Setup/Windows/enterprise-workstation-setup.ps1`
-   `../VM-Setup/Linux/corporate-server-breach.sh`

## Additional Notes

-   Exercises range in difficulty from basic familiarization to complex incident response scenarios.
-   Focus on understanding the *why* behind each step, not just completing the task.
-   Document your steps and findings as you work through the exercises, simulating competition documentation.
