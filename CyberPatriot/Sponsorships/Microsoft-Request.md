**Subject: Nonprofit Technology Support Request for Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot Program**

Dear Microsoft Philanthropies Team,

I am writing on behalf of the cadet-led Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program in Huntsville, Alabama, to request support through Microsoft's nonprofit technology programs. Our program aligns with Microsoft's commitment to expanding digital skills and empowering students through technology education.

## About Our Program

The Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program participates in the Air Force Association's National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, which challenges students to find and fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities in virtual operating systems. Through this program, our cadets:

- Develop practical skills in Windows security configurations and policies
- Learn to identify and remediate common cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- Apply security patches and updates in controlled environments
- Configure and monitor security tools to protect network resources
- Build teamwork and critical thinking skills under time pressure

## Our Challenge and Request

Traditionally, our program has received support through National Guard funding and other military-related sources. Due to recent changes in government funding allocations, we are facing significant resource constraints that limit our ability to effectively prepare students for competition and careers in cybersecurity.

We are seeking Microsoft's support through your nonprofit technology programs in the following areas:

1. **Software Donations**:
   - Windows operating system licenses for our training computers
   - Microsoft 365 licenses for team collaboration
   - Azure credits for creating virtual training environments

2. **Hardware Donations**
   - 5-10 laptop computers capable of running virtual machines needed for CyberPatriot competition preparation

3. **Technical Training Resources**:
   - Access to Microsoft cybersecurity training materials
   - Educational resources on Windows security configurations

4. **Professional Mentorship**:
   - Connections with Microsoft security professionals who might volunteer as team mentor

## Alignment with Microsoft's Mission

Our request aligns with Microsoft's commitment to:

1. **Digital Skills Development**: We provide hands-on training in critical cybersecurity skills.
2. **Educational Equity**: We make specialized technology education accessible to diverse students.
3. **Future Workforce Development**: We prepare students for careers in the growing cybersecurity field.
4. **Community Impact**: We strengthen Huntsville's position as a technology hub.

## Program Impact

With Microsoft's support, we aim to:
- Increase student participation from [current number] to [goal number]
- Improve our competition performance through better training resources
- Enhance college and career readiness for all participants
- Diversify the future cybersecurity workforce

## Our Commitment

As a 501(c)(3) organization, we ensure all donations directly benefit student learning. Our program is supervised by qualified JROTC instructors and mentored by industry professionals, including Matt Mueller, Director of AI and Automation at Teledyne Technologies.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this request further and can provide any additional information you may require. Please contact us at [phone number] or [email].

Thank you for considering our request.

Sincerely,
