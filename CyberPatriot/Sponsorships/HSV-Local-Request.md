**Subject: Local Technology Support Request for Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot Program**

Dear [Contact Name],

As a leading technology company in the Huntsville area, [Company Name] has demonstrated a commitment to our community's growth and development. I am writing on behalf of the cadet-led Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program to request your support in developing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals right here in Huntsville.

## About Our Program

The Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program participates in the Air Force Association's National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, which places students in the role of IT professionals managing the network of a small company. Our cadets learn to:

- Identify and fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- Secure networks while maintaining critical services
- Respond to simulated cyber threats in real-time
- Work collaboratively under pressure
- Develop leadership and communication skills

## The Huntsville Connection

As you know, Huntsville has established itself as a technology and defense hub, with cybersecurity playing an increasingly vital role. Our program directly contributes to the local talent pipeline that companies like yours depend on. Many of our former cadets have gone on to study cybersecurity in college and pursue careers with Huntsville-area companies.

## Our Current Need

Recent changes in traditional funding sources, including National Guard support, have created significant challenges for our program. We've seen the success of similar programs, such as Bob Jones AFJROTC CyberPatriot team, which received critical equipment donations from local companies Aleta Technologies and MITRE.

We are seeking support in the following areas:

1. **Equipment Donations**:
   - Laptop computers for team practice and competition
   - Networking equipment for hands-on training
   - Peripherals (monitors, keyboards, etc.)

2. **Technical Expertise**:
   - Volunteer mentors from your cybersecurity team
   - Guest speakers to discuss industry trends and careers
   - Technical guidance on competition preparation

3. **Financial Support**:
   - Competition registration fees
   - Transportation to competitions
   - Training materials and resources

## Benefits to [Company Name]

Supporting our program offers several advantages to your company:

1. **Talent Pipeline Development**: Invest in future employees with relevant skills and interest in your industry.
2. **Community Recognition**: Be recognized as a supporter of STEM education in Huntsville.
3. **Employee Engagement**: Provide meaningful volunteer opportunities for your technical staff.
4. **Tax Benefits**: As a 501(c)(3) organization, your donations are tax-deductible.

## Our Commitment

We ensure all donations directly benefit student learning and program sustainability. Our program is supervised by qualified JROTC instructors and mentored by industry professionals, including Matt Mueller, Director of AI and Automation at Teledyne Technologies.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this partnership in person and can arrange for you to meet our cadets and see our program in action. Please contact me at [phone number] or [email] to schedule a conversation.

Thank you for considering our request. Together, we can strengthen Huntsville's position as a leader in cybersecurity education and innovation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
