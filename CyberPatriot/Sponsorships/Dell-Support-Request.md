**Subject: Technology Support Request for Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot Program**

Dear Dell Technologies Corporate Social Responsibility Team,

I am writing on behalf of the cadet-led Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program in Huntsville, Alabama. We recently learned about Dell's commitment to digital inclusion and technology education through your Technology Grant Program and TechSoup partnership.

## About Our Program

The Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program participates in the Air Force Association's National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, which prepares students for careers in cybersecurity and STEM fields. Our program:

- Trains students to identify vulnerabilities in simulated network environments
- Teaches essential cybersecurity skills through hands-on practice
- Develops critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in high-pressure situations
- Prepares students for in-demand careers in the cybersecurity sector
- Builds leadership skills through a cadet-led team structure

## Current Challenge

Traditionally, our program has received support through National Guard funding and other military-related sources. However, recent government changes have affected this funding, leaving us without the necessary technology resources to effectively train our cadets.

## Our Specific Request

We are seeking Dell's support through your Technology Grant Program or Digital Inclusion initiative in the form of:

1. **5-10 laptop computers** capable of running virtual machines needed for CyberPatriot competition preparation
2. **Technical mentorship** from Dell cybersecurity professionals who could provide guidance to our team
3. **Software and networking tools** to create practice environments

## Alignment with Dell's Mission

Our request aligns perfectly with Dell's commitment to digital inclusion and education:

1. **Closing the Digital Divide**: Your support would provide technology access to students who may not otherwise have these opportunities.
2. **Workforce Development**: You would help prepare diverse students for careers in the growing cybersecurity field, where there is a significant talent shortage.
3. **STEM Education**: Your support would encourage more students to pursue technology-related fields.

## Our Commitment

As a 501(c)(3) organization, we ensure all donations directly benefit student learning. Our program is supervised by qualified JROTC instructors and mentored by industry professionals, including Matt Mueller, Director of AI and Automation at Teledyne Technologies.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss this partnership further. Please contact us at [phone number] or [email] to explore how Dell can help develop the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

Thank you for considering our request.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
