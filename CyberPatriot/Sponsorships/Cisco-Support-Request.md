**Subject: Technology Grant Request for Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot Program**

Dear Cisco Technology Grant Program Team,

I am writing on behalf of the cadet-led Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program in Huntsville, Alabama, to apply for support through Cisco's Technology Grant Program. After reviewing your grant criteria, we believe our program aligns perfectly with Cisco's commitment to education and economic empowerment.

## About Our Program

The Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program participates in the Air Force Association's National Youth Cyber Defense Competition, the nation's largest youth cyber defense competition. Our team of cadets learns to:

- Identify and remediate network vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux environments
- Configure and monitor network security appliances
- Apply cybersecurity best practices in time-sensitive scenarios
- Work collaboratively to protect critical digital infrastructure

## Current Situation and Need

Our program has traditionally received support through various military-related funding sources including the National Guard. However, recent changes in government funding have created a significant gap in our resources. To maintain and expand our program's effectiveness, we need:

1. **Networking equipment** for our dedicated cybersecurity practice lab
2. **Security appliances** to simulate real-world network environments
3. **Training resources** specific to network security and threat assessment
4. **Technical mentorship** from cybersecurity professionals

## Alignment with Cisco's Social Impact Goals

Our request aligns with several of Cisco's stated social impact priorities:

1. **Education**: We provide specialized technology education to students who may not otherwise have access to cybersecurity training.
2. **Economic Empowerment**: We prepare students for high-demand careers in the cybersecurity sector, which faces a significant global talent shortage.
3. **Technology for Good**: The skills our students learn help protect critical digital infrastructure.
4. **Scale and Replication**: Our model can be replicated across other JROTC programs nationwide.

## Program Impact

With Cisco's support, we anticipate the following outcomes:

- Increased participation in our CyberPatriot program (from [current number] to [goal number] students)
- Improved competition performance through better training resources
- Enhanced career readiness for students entering cybersecurity fields
- Greater diversity in the cybersecurity talent pipeline

## Our Request

We are specifically requesting consideration for the following support:

1. Cisco networking equipment donations through your Technology Grant Program
2. Security software licenses for training purposes
3. Potential volunteer mentorship from Cisco cybersecurity professionals

## Our Commitment

As a 501(c)(3) organization, we ensure all donations directly benefit student learning. Our program is supervised by qualified JROTC instructors and mentored by industry professionals, including Matt Mueller, Director of AI and Automation at Teledyne Technologies.

We would be honored to discuss our application further and can provide any additional information you may require. Please contact us at [phone number] or [email].

Thank you for considering our application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
