# CyberPatriot Team Resources

This directory contains guides, templates, and protocols to help CyberPatriot teams organize their strategy, workflow, roles, and communication for effective competition performance. These focus on the 'soft skills' and organizational aspects crucial for success.

## Resource Index

-   [**Competition_Strategy_Guide.md**](Competition_Strategy_Guide.md)
    *   Outlines key strategic elements: team roles, workflow phases, communication tips, and unique approaches for success. Emphasizes baselining and prioritizing.
-   [**incident_response_workflow.md**](incident_response_workflow.md)
    *   A simplified step-by-step workflow for tackling a competition image, emphasizing reading the README first and following a structured approach (Users -> Persistence -> Services -> Policies -> Forensics).
-   [**communication_protocols.md**](communication_protocols.md)
    *   Defines structured communication methods like SITREP (Situation Report) and BLOCKER protocols for use during competition to maintain situational awareness and resolve issues efficiently.
-   [**team_formation.md**](team_formation.md)
    *   Guidelines for structuring a team, assigning primary/backup roles based on strengths (Windows, Linux, Cisco, Docs/Forensics, Orchestrator), and the importance of cross-training.
-   [**practice_schedule.md**](practice_schedule.md)
    *   A template for organizing weekly and monthly team practice sessions, suggesting focus areas and simulation types.
-   [**competition_workflow.md**](competition_workflow.md)
    *   (Potentially overlaps with incident_response_workflow.md - review/merge needed) A detailed workflow for competition day, possibly including pre-competition setup and post-competition debrief steps.
