## Getting Started

1. Begin by installing Cisco Packet Tracer using the instructions in the [Setup](./Setup) directory.
2. Review the basic networking concepts in the [Guides/Basic](./Guides/Basic) directory.
3. Try the introductory exercises and scenarios in [Exercises](./Exercises) and [PacketTracer/Scenarios](./PacketTracer/Scenarios).
4. Progress to more advanced topics as you build your skills.

## Learning Path

For optimal learning, we recommend following this sequence:

1. Basic networking fundamentals (IP addressing, subnetting, protocols)
2. Basic router and switch configuration
3. Securing network devices (passwords, SSH, ACLs)
4. VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
5. Network security concepts
6. Advanced security configurations

## CyberPatriot Competition Tips

- The Cisco Networking Challenge typically involves:
  - Configuring network devices according to specifications
  - Implementing security measures
  - Troubleshooting network issues
  - Answering quiz questions about networking concepts
- Focus on securing all network devices with strong passwords
- Disable unnecessary services
- Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict traffic
- Document your configurations for quick reference
