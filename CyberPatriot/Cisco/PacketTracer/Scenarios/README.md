# Packet Tracer Scenarios

This directory contains Packet Tracer scenario files (.pkt) that simulate various network configurations for practice. Each scenario is designed to help develop skills needed for the CyberPatriot Cisco Networking Challenge.

## Available Scenarios

### Basic Level

1. **Basic_Network_Security.pkt**
   - A simple network with a router, switch, and endpoints
   - Focus on basic device security configuration
   - Suitable for beginners learning Cisco IOS security commands

2. **Basic_VLAN_Setup.pkt**
   - Introduction to VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
   - Practice configuring VLANs on switches
   - Configure a router-on-a-stick topology

### Intermediate Level

3. **ACL_Implementation.pkt**
   - Practice implementing standard and extended ACLs
   - Filter traffic between different network segments
   - Secure a small network while maintaining required connectivity

4. **Remote_Access_Security.pkt**
   - Secure remote access configuration
   - SSH setup and configuration
   - Management access restrictions

### Advanced Level

5. **Enterprise_Network_Security.pkt**
   - Complex network with multiple routers and switches
   - Implementation of routing protocols with security
   - Multi-layered security approach
   - Advanced ACLs and filtering techniques

6. **Network_Troubleshooting.pkt**
   - A network with intentional security misconfigurations
   - Practice identifying and fixing security issues
   - Simulates a CyberPatriot competition scenario

## Using These Scenarios

1. Download the scenario file
2. Open it in Cisco Packet Tracer
3. Read the accompanying exercise document in the [Exercises](../../Exercises) directory
4. Complete the required tasks
5. Verify your solution against the corresponding solution file in the [Solutions](../Solutions) directory

## Scenario Development Notes

- All scenarios are created using Packet Tracer version 8.0 or later
- Each scenario includes notes within the Packet Tracer file that explain the setup
- Scenarios are designed to mimic real-world network security challenges
- All scenarios have been tested to ensure they are solvable

## Creating Your Own Scenarios

If you'd like to contribute your own Packet Tracer scenarios:

1. Follow the naming convention: `[Difficulty]_[Topic]_[Description].pkt`
2. Include clear notes within the Packet Tracer file
3. Create an accompanying exercise document
4. Provide a solution file
5. Submit a pull request with all files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with any scenario file:

- Ensure you're using a compatible version of Packet Tracer
- Check that all devices power on properly
- Verify the initial configurations are loaded
- Consult the troubleshooting section in the exercise document
