# Security Checklists

This directory contains comprehensive security checklists for Windows, Linux, and Cisco systems that will help cadets secure systems during CyberPatriot competitions. These checklists are designed to be practical, thorough, and easy to follow under competition time constraints.

## Overview

Security checklists are essential tools in cybersecurity competitions like CyberPatriot. They provide:

- A systematic approach to securing systems
- A way to ensure critical security issues aren't overlooked
- Documentation of completed security tasks
- A reference for common vulnerabilities and fixes

## How to Use These Checklists

1. **Before the competition:**
   - Review all checklists to become familiar with the security measures
   - Practice implementing the security measures on test systems
   - Understand the reasoning behind each checklist item
   - Customize the checklists based on team preferences and strategies

2. **During the competition:**
   - Use the appropriate checklist for each system (Windows, Linux, Cisco)
   - Check off items as they are completed
   - Document points earned for each security fix
   - Note any unusual issues or custom configurations needed

3. **After the competition:**
   - Review which checklist items earned points
   - Identify missed vulnerabilities
   - Update checklists with new findings for future competitions

## Checklist Categories

### Windows Security Checklist
Comprehensive checklist for securing Windows workstations and servers, covering user management, services, network security, and system policies.

### Linux Security Checklist
Detailed checklist for securing Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS), covering user accounts, permissions, services, and system hardening.

### Cisco Security Checklist
Complete checklist for securing Cisco network devices, covering authentication, services, interfaces, and network protocols.

## Checklist Format

Each checklist follows a consistent format:

- **Category headers** for logical grouping of related items
- **Actionable items** with specific commands or steps where appropriate
- **Verification steps** to confirm security measures are working
- **Reference notes** for additional information
- **Priority indicators** for high-impact security measures

## Best Practices for Using Checklists

1. **Divide and conquer:** Assign team members to specific sections of the checklists
2. **Verify changes:** Always verify that security changes don't break functionality
3. **Document everything:** Note all changes made, especially non-standard configurations
4. **Prioritize high-impact items:** Focus on security measures that are likely to earn points
5. **Follow the order:** The checklists are arranged to minimize system disruption

## Customizing Checklists

Teams are encouraged to customize these checklists based on:

- Team member expertise
- Competition image specifics
- Time management strategies
- Point-earning effectiveness from past competitions

Remember to save any custom versions of these checklists for future use.
