# Malware Removal Exercise

## Overview

Practice identifying and removing simulated malware and persistence mechanisms from a Windows system, as required in CyberPatriot competitions.

## Objectives

- Detect malware and persistence mechanisms
- Remove malicious files, services, and registry entries
- Clean up compromised system artifacts

## Tasks

1. **Identify suspicious processes and services**
   - Use Task Manager and PowerShell: `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`

2. **Check startup items and scheduled tasks**
   - PowerShell: `Get-CimInstance Win32_StartupCommand`
   - Task Scheduler: Review all scheduled tasks

3. **Scan for malware**
   - Run Windows Defender full scan

4. **Remove unauthorized or malicious files**
   - Delete files from suspicious locations (e.g., temp, startup folders)

5. **Remove malicious services**
   - PowerShell: `Remove-Service -Name "ServiceName"`

6. **Clean up registry persistence**
   - Remove unauthorized entries from Run keys

7. **Document all actions**
   - List malware found and steps taken

## Verification

- Confirm system is clean and all malicious items are removed

## Reflection

- What are common persistence mechanisms used by malware?
- Why is documentation important during incident response?
