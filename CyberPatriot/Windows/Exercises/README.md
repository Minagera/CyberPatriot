3. Document your actions and findings
4. Reflect on the questions at the end
5. Review solutions (mentors only) after attempting the exercise

## Setting Up Your Practice Environment

- Use the VM setup instructions in the [VM-Setup](../VM-Setup) directory
- Take a snapshot before starting each exercise

## Exercise Files

Some exercises reference downloadable files such as:
- VM configuration scripts
- Pre-configured scenarios
- Tools for specific exercises
- Documentation templates

These files can be found in the individual exercise directories when applicable.

## Team Practice Scenarios

For teams preparing for CyberPatriot:

1. **Time trials**: Set a timer and see how many issues can be fixed in a limited time
2. **Role rotation**: Have team members take turns addressing different aspects of security
3. **Documentation practice**: Have one team member document while others implement fixes
4. **Red team/blue team**: Have one group introduce security issues for others to find
5. **Mock competitions**: Simulate a full competition environment with time limits
