- Disabled or misconfigured Windows Defender and Firewall
- Malicious scheduled tasks and startup items
- Weak password and lockout policies
- Unnecessary or vulnerable services enabled
- Suspicious software and browser extensions
- Forensic artifacts and a README.txt with scenario tasks and questions

## Usage
