- Have troubleshooting guides ready for SELinux/AppArmor issues
- Consider having pre-configured environments if configurations are time-consuming
- Emphasize practical skills that will be useful in competition
- Include real examples from past CyberPatriot Linux challenges
- Prepare a recovery plan for systems that become unusable due to security configurations
- Consider bringing in guest speaker with Linux security expertise if available
- Focus on configurations commonly checked in CyberPatriot scoring
- Include a mix of GUI and command-line approaches where possible
