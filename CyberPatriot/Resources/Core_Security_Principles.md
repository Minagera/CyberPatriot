# Core Cybersecurity Principles

Understanding these principles is essential for success in CyberPatriot and real-world security roles.

## 1. Confidentiality
- Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- Use strong passwords, access controls, and encryption.

## 2. Integrity
- Protect data from unauthorized modification or destruction.
- Use checksums, file integrity monitoring, and version control.

## 3. Availability
- Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.
- Use backups, redundancy, and robust system design.

## 4. Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- Combine technical, administrative, and physical safeguards.

## 5. Least Privilege
- Grant users only the access necessary for their role.
- Regularly review and adjust permissions.

## 6. Separation of Duties
- Divide critical tasks among multiple people to reduce risk.
- Prevent fraud and errors by requiring collaboration.

## 7. Need to Know
- Limit access to information based on job requirements.
- Avoid unnecessary data exposure.

## 8. Security Controls
- Use preventive, detective, and corrective controls.
- Examples: firewalls (preventive), logs (detective), backups (corrective).

## 9. Risk Assessment
- Identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks to systems and data.
- Apply controls based on risk level and impact.

## 10. Security Compliance
- Follow relevant laws, regulations, and standards.
- Document policies and procedures for accountability.

*Apply these principles in every CyberPatriot scenario for maximum points and real-world readiness!*
