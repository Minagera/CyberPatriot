# Core Cybersecurity Principles for CyberPatriot

Understanding these principles is essential for making sound security decisions during the competition and in real-world scenarios.

## 1. Confidentiality
-   **Goal:** Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive information. Prevent unauthorized disclosure.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Use strong passwords, check file permissions (NTFS/Linux), remove unauthorized users, secure remote access (SSH/RDP), encrypt sensitive data (if applicable).

## 2. Integrity
-   **Goal:** Protect data and system configurations from unauthorized modification or destruction. Ensure accuracy and trustworthiness.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Use file integrity monitoring concepts (baselining), check file hashes (if provided), restrict write permissions, use secure configurations, check for unauthorized changes in logs or config files.

## 3. Availability
-   **Goal:** Ensure systems, services, and data are accessible to authorized users when needed.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** **Crucially, do NOT disable required services mentioned in the README.** Ensure critical services are running and configured correctly, manage firewall rules carefully to avoid blocking required access, ensure system stability (avoid risky changes).

## 4. Defense in Depth
-   **Goal:** Implement multiple layers of security controls (technical, administrative, physical). If one layer fails, others provide protection.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Combine strong passwords, firewall rules, antivirus, secure service configurations, user permissions, auditing, and security policies. Don't rely on just one fix.

## 5. Least Privilege
-   **Goal:** Grant users and processes only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their required functions.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Remove users from the Administrators/sudo group unless necessary, assign standard user roles, configure service accounts with minimal rights, check file/share permissions to remove `Everyone` or overly broad access.

## 6. Separation of Duties
-   **Goal:** Divide critical tasks among multiple people or roles to prevent fraud, errors, or abuse of power.
-   **CyberPatriot Relevance:** While less directly applicable in the competition structure, it underlies why distinct admin/user roles exist. Understand why giving one user all privileges is risky.

## 7. Need to Know
-   **Goal:** Limit access to specific information based on job requirements or authorization, even within the same privilege level.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Primarily relates to file permissions. Ensure users in one department (if simulated) can't access files of another unless authorized.

## 8. Security Controls (Types)
-   **Preventive:** Stop incidents from happening (e.g., Firewall rules, strong passwords, permissions).
-   **Detective:** Identify incidents when they occur (e.g., Audit logs, antivirus alerts, intrusion detection systems - less common in CP).
-   **Corrective:** Remediate incidents or limit damage (e.g., Removing malware, restoring from backup - backup not usually CP, fixing misconfigurations).
-   **CyberPatriot Focus:** Primarily Preventive and Corrective, with some Detective work (analyzing logs for forensics).

## 9. Risk Assessment (Simplified for CP)
-   **Goal:** Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, assess their likelihood and impact, and prioritize mitigation.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** Prioritize fixing vulnerabilities mentioned in the README, address issues granting admin/root access first, fix easily exploitable services (e.g., Telnet, weak passwords).

## 10. Security Compliance (Simplified for CP)
-   **Goal:** Adhere to relevant rules, policies, and standards.
-   **CyberPatriot Actions:** **Follow the competition README and Rules Book strictly.** Apply security best practices *unless* contradicted by the README. Document actions taken.
