# CyberPatriot Documentation Templates

This directory provides templates for common documentation tasks during CyberPatriot competitions. Using templates ensures consistency and saves valuable time.

## Available Templates

-   [**Change_Log_Template.md**](Change_Log_Template.md)
    *   For tracking every modification made to the systems (user changes, service changes, policy updates, software removal, etc.). Essential for troubleshooting and potential scoring verification.
-   [**Incident_Response_Report_Template.md**](Incident_Response_Report_Template.md)
    *   A more formal template for summarizing findings, actions taken, and recommendations, simulating a real-world report (useful for practice/debrief).
-   [**Team_Workflow_Checklist.md**](Team_Workflow_Checklist.md)
    *   A high-level checklist for the team to follow during the competition (Read README, Baseline, Users, etc.). Adaptable version of strategies discussed elsewhere.
-   [**Forensics_Question_Response_Template.md**](Forensics_Question_Response_Template.md)
    *   A structured template for answering the forensic questions provided in the competition README, including space for the question, answer, and evidence/justification.

## How to Use

1.  Review these templates *before* the competition.
2.  Adapt them slightly if needed for your team's workflow.
3.  Have digital or printed copies ready at the start of the competition.
4.  Fill them out diligently *during* the competition. The Change Log is particularly critical.

*Consistent documentation is key to avoiding mistakes and ensuring all forensic points are captured.*
