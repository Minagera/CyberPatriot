# CyberPatriot Tools & Utilities

This directory is a placeholder for potential future tools, scripts, or conceptual guides related to automation, baselining aids, or scenario generation that might be useful across platforms or for training setup.

**Note:** Platform-specific audit/hardening scripts should reside in the respective `Windows/Scripts/` or `Linux/Scripts/` directories.

## Potential Future Content

-   **Automated Baselining Concepts/Scripts:** Guides or example scripts (e.g., using PowerShell or Bash to export configurations like user lists, service states, installed packages) to facilitate comparison with tools like Meld.
    *   [**Baselining_Export_Examples.md**](Baselining_Export_Examples.md) (Placeholder)
-   **Scenario Randomizer Concepts:** Ideas or simple scripts to help instructors randomize elements within VM setup scripts (e.g., pick random usernames from a list, slightly vary vulnerabilities).
    *   [**Scenario_Randomization_Ideas.md**](Scenario_Randomization_Ideas.md) (Placeholder)
-   **Cross-Platform Audit Script Concepts:** Ideas for scripts that might attempt to gather similar information (e.g., user lists) from both Windows and Linux using appropriate native commands.

## Contribution

If you develop tools or scripts that aid in CyberPatriot training setup, baselining, or have cross-platform utility beyond simple auditing, consider adding them here with clear documentation.
