# CyberPatriot Resources

This directory contains unique reference materials, templates, core principle guides, and potentially tools to support CyberPatriot training and competition preparation.

## Directory Structure

-   [**Templates/**](Templates/README.md)
    *   Documentation, reporting, and workflow templates for use during competition (e.g., Change Log, Incident Report, Forensics Answers).
-   [**References/**](References/README.md)
    *   Quick reference sheets ("cheat sheets"), command summaries, and configuration snippets for Windows, Linux, and Cisco.
-   [**Tools/**](Tools/README.md)
    *   Placeholder for potential future scripts or utilities for automation, baselining aids, or scenario generation concepts (distinct from platform-specific audit/setup scripts).
-   [**Core_Security_Principles.md**](Core_Security_Principles.md)
    *   Fundamental cybersecurity concepts (CIA Triad, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, etc.) relevant to CyberPatriot decision-making.

## How to Use These Resources

1.  **Templates:** Review and adapt templates *before* competitions for efficient documentation during the event. Practice using them.
2.  **References:** Keep reference sheets handy (digitally or printed) during practice and competition for quick lookups of commands, file paths, or tool names.
3.  **Core Principles:** Understand these concepts to guide your security decisions and justify your actions.
4.  **Contribute:** Add useful commands, checklist items, template improvements, or suggest tools.

## Example Resources

-   Change Log Template ([Templates/Change_Log_Template.md](Templates/Change_Log_Template.md))
-   Windows/Linux/Cisco Command Cheat Sheets ([References/](References/README.md))
-   Core Security Principles ([Core_Security_Principles.md](Core_Security_Principles.md))

## Contribution Guidelines

-   All resources must be original or clearly attributed if based on external concepts, and tailored for CyberPatriot use.
-   Clearly document the purpose and usage of each file.
-   Submit improvements or new resources via pull request. Ensure uniqueness.
