# Cisco Packet Tracer Setup Information

This directory provides guidance related to setting up the environment for Cisco networking exercises within CyberPatriot training.

## Packet Tracer Software

CyberPatriot Cisco challenges are typically performed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. Ensure all team members have a compatible version installed. Packet Tracer can usually be downloaded for free via the Cisco Networking Academy website ([www.netacad.com](https://www.netacad.com/)). Check the current CyberPatriot season rules for any specific version requirements.

## Scenario Files (.pkt)

The actual practice scenarios are provided as Packet Tracer files (`.pkt`). These files contain pre-built network topologies, device configurations (often incomplete or insecure), and specific instructions or scoring elements.

**Scenario files for this program are located in:**
[**../../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/**](../../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/)

Refer to the `README.md` file within that directory for a list and description of available scenarios.

## Usage

1.  Install Cisco Packet Tracer.
2.  Download `.pkt` files from the `Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/` directory.
3.  Open the `.pkt` file in Packet Tracer.
4.  Follow the instructions provided within the Packet Tracer scenario (often in the yellow notes) and/or the corresponding exercise file in `../../Cisco/Exercises/`.
5.  Use the Packet Tracer interface and device CLIs to complete the required configuration and security tasks.
