# CyberPatriot VM-Setup Directory Index

This directory contains all setup scripts, scenario generators, and documentation for preparing Windows, Linux, and Cisco Packet Tracer virtual environments for CyberPatriot training and competition practice. The goal is to create realistic scenarios that mimic the challenges faced in actual competitions, focusing on incident response and remediation.

*(Note: Actual Packet Tracer `.pkt` files reside in `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/`)*

## Windows VM-Setup

-   **[Windows/README.md](Windows/README.md)**: Full instructions for using the PowerShell script to create a compromised Windows VM.
-   **[Windows/enterprise-workstation-setup.ps1](Windows/enterprise-workstation-setup.ps1)**: PowerShell script that adds users, weakens security, adds persistence, and creates forensic artifacts including a README.

---

## Linux VM-Setup

-   **[Linux/README.md](Linux/README.md)**: Detailed guide for using the Bash scripts to create a post-breach Linux VM.
-   **[Linux/corporate-server-breach.sh](Linux/corporate-server-breach.sh)**: Bash script implementing a specific "Corporate Server Breach" scenario.
-   **[Linux/cyberpatriot_linux_vm_setup.sh](Linux/cyberpatriot_linux_vm_setup.sh)**: Alternative Bash script with more customizable variables for instructors.

---

## Cisco Packet Tracer Setup

-   **[Cisco/README.md](Cisco/README.md)**: Provides guidance on using Cisco Packet Tracer for network scenario training.
-   Packet Tracer scenario files (`.pkt`) are located in the main Cisco directory: **[../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/](../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/)**. These files contain pre-built network topologies with specific configuration and security challenges.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Choose your platform** (Windows or Linux for VM setup).
2.  **Navigate to the platform subdirectory** (e.g., `VM-Setup/Windows/`).
3.  **Read the `README.md`** in that subdirectory for detailed setup steps.
4.  **Prepare a clean base VM** of the appropriate OS (Win 10/11 or Ubuntu 22.04 recommended). **Snapshot the clean state.**
5.  **Run the provided setup script** (`.ps1` or `.sh`) **as Administrator/root** on the clean VM.
6.  **Review script output and logs** for errors.
7.  **Snapshot the VM** in its compromised state after the script finishes. This is the snapshot to distribute to cadets.
8.  For Cisco, download Packet Tracer and use the `.pkt` files from `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/`.

## Customization

-   All setup scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) are designed for instructor modification.
-   Edit the scripts to adjust usernames, passwords, IPs, persistence methods, services, and scenario difficulty.
-   Modify the content of the competition-style README files generated by the scripts to match your training objectives.

---

## Troubleshooting

-   Ensure scripts are run with appropriate privileges (Administrator/root).
-   Verify the base VM OS version is compatible with the script.
-   Check script logs (`C:\setup_log_cyberpatriot.txt` or `/var/log/cyberpatriot_setup.log`) for error details.
-   Ensure network connectivity if scripts need to download packages or run updates.
-   Use VM snapshots to quickly revert to a clean or initial compromised state.
-   For Packet Tracer, ensure you are using a compatible version.

## Contribution

-   If you create new scenarios or significantly improve existing scripts, please contribute them back.
-   Ensure any new scenarios align with the CyberPatriot incident response focus.
-   All files must be unique and tailored for CyberPatriot training.
