## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose your platform** (Windows, Linux, or Cisco).
2. **Read the README.md** in the relevant subdirectory for setup steps.
3. **Run the provided setup script** (as Administrator/root for Windows/Linux).
4. **Take a VM snapshot** after setup for repeatable practice.
5. **Distribute the VM or Packet Tracer file** to cadets for training.
6. **Follow the competition-style README** generated on the desktop for scenario instructions.

## Customization

- All setup scripts are designed for instructor modification.
- Adjust usernames, passwords, IPs, and scenario difficulty as needed.
- Add or remove vulnerabilities to tailor the challenge for your team.
- Update scenario README files to match your training objectives.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a script fails, check for correct OS version, sufficient disk space, and network connectivity.
- Review the log files generated by each setup script for error details.
- Use VM snapshots to quickly reset to a clean state.
- For Packet Tracer, ensure you are using the correct version for the provided .pkt files.

## Contribution

- If you create new scenarios or improve existing scripts, contribute them back to the repository.
- All files must be unique and tailored for CyberPatriot training.
