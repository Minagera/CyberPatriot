# CyberPatriot VM-Setup Directory

This directory provides scripts and documentation for creating unique, compromised virtual machine environments (Windows, Linux) and Cisco Packet Tracer scenarios suitable for realistic CyberPatriot incident response training.

**Goal:** To simulate the initial state of a CyberPatriot competition image, allowing cadets to practice identification, remediation, and hardening skills.

## Directory Structure

-   [**Windows/**](Windows/README.md): Contains `enterprise-workstation-setup.ps1` script and `README.md` for setting up a compromised Windows VM.
-   [**Linux/**](Linux/README.md): Contains `corporate-server-breach.sh` script and `README.md` for setting up a compromised Linux (Ubuntu) VM.
-   [**Cisco/**](Cisco/README.md): Contains `README.md` explaining how to use Packet Tracer files from `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/` for network-based exercises and practice.

## Usage Instructions (General)

1.  **Choose your platform** (Windows or Linux for VM setup, Cisco for Packet Tracer).
2.  **Navigate to the platform subdirectory** (e.g., `VM-Setup/Windows/`).
3.  **Read the `README.md`** in that subdirectory for detailed setup steps specific to that platform.
4.  **Prepare a clean base VM** of the appropriate OS (Win 10/11 Pro/Enterprise or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended). **Snapshot the clean state** before running any scripts.
5.  **Transfer the setup script** (`.ps1` or `.sh`) to the clean VM.
6.  **Run the provided setup script** **as Administrator/root** on the clean VM.
7.  **Review script output and logs** (e.g., `C:\setup_log_cyberpatriot.txt` or `/var/log/cyberpatriot_setup.log`) for errors.
8.  **Shut down the VM** after the script finishes successfully.
9.  **Snapshot the VM** in its compromised state (e.g., "Windows Compromised Initial State"). This is the snapshot to distribute to cadets for practice.
10. For Cisco, download Packet Tracer and use the `.pkt` files from `../Cisco/PacketTracer_Scenarios/`.

## Customization

-   All setup scripts (`.ps1`, `.sh`) are designed for instructor modification.
-   Edit the scripts to adjust usernames, passwords, IPs, persistence methods, services, vulnerabilities, and scenario difficulty.
-   Modify the content of the competition-style README files generated by the scripts (e.g., `README-Incident.txt`) to match your training objectives and add specific forensic questions.

---

## Troubleshooting

-   Ensure scripts are run with appropriate privileges (Administrator/root).
-   Verify the base VM OS version is compatible with the script (check script comments/README).
-   Check script logs for error details.
-   Ensure network connectivity if scripts need to download packages or run updates (though ideally, they should be self-contained or use local resources).
-   Use VM snapshots frequently to quickly revert to a clean or initial compromised state.
-   For Packet Tracer, ensure you are using a compatible version.

## Contribution

-   If you create new scenarios or significantly improve existing scripts, please contribute them back via pull request.
-   Ensure any new scenarios align with the CyberPatriot incident response focus and introduce realistic vulnerabilities/misconfigurations.
-   All files must be unique and tailored for CyberPatriot training.
