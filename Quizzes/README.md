## How to Use

-   **Cadets:** Access quizzes via the `Quiz-Files/` directory or through links in the platform-specific directories (`../Windows/Quizzes/Quiz-Files/`, etc.). Use them to self-assess understanding of topics from the Curriculum and Guides.
-   **Mentors:** Use quizzes for formal or informal assessment. Access answer keys and explanations in the `Solutions/` directory to review cadet work and guide discussions. **Strictly adhere to the Mentor-Use Policy.**

## Quiz Types

-   **General:** User Account Security, Incident Response, Competition Strategy, Core Principles.
-   **Windows:** Fundamentals (Tools, GUI, Basic Commands) and Hardening (Policies, Services, Firewall, Defender).
-   **Linux:** Fundamentals (CLI, Users, Permissions) and Hardening (UFW, SSH, Services, PAM).
-   **Cisco:** IOS Basics (Commands, Modes), Security (Passwords, SSH, ACLs), Packet Tracer usage/interpretation.

## Quiz Creation and Contribution

-   Follow the established format for consistency (e.g., Multiple Choice, True/False, Short Answer, Scenario-based).
-   Include a mix of question types relevant to CyberPatriot tasks and incident response thinking.
-   Provide clear solutions with explanations in the `Solutions/` directory. Name solution files clearly corresponding to quiz files.
-   Ensure questions are unique, test understanding (the *why*), not just memorization, and align with Nationals-level expectations.
-   Submit contributions via pull request, placing new quiz files in the appropriate `Quiz-Files/` directory (general or platform-specific) and solutions in the main `Solutions/` directory.

## Mentor-Use Policy for Solutions

**Solutions are intended for mentors and instructors ONLY** to facilitate review, grading, and discussion. **DO NOT** share answer keys or solution files directly with cadets before they have attempted the quizzes. Maintaining the integrity of assessments is crucial for effective learning.
