# Contributing to the Grissom CyberPatriot Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your help is valuable in keeping these training materials effective, up-to-date, and unique for preparing cadets for the CyberPatriot competition.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Uniqueness:** All contributed content (guides, exercises, scripts, quizzes, templates, etc.) must be original work or significantly adapted and tailored specifically for the CyberPatriot training context of this repository. Avoid direct copying from external sources. Attribute ideas where appropriate, but the implementation must be unique.
2.  **Relevance:** Content should directly support preparation for the CyberPatriot competition, focusing on the skills, tools, and mindset needed for success, particularly at the Nationals level (incident response, hardening, forensics).
3.  **Accuracy:** Ensure technical information, commands, and configurations are accurate for the specified platforms (Windows 10/11, Ubuntu 22.04, Cisco IOS/Packet Tracer).
4.  **Clarity:** Write guides and instructions clearly and concisely. Comment scripts effectively. Ensure exercises and quizzes have clear objectives.
5.  **Structure:** Follow the existing directory structure and file naming conventions where possible. Use Markdown for documentation.
