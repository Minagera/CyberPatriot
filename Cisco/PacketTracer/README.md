# Cisco Packet Tracer Scenarios for CyberPatriot

This directory contains Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) files used for various exercises, demonstrations, and practice scenarios within the CyberPatriot training program.

## File Naming Convention (Suggestion)

-   `ExerciseName_Start.pkt`: The initial state of a network for an exercise.
-   `ExerciseName_Solution.pkt`: The completed or target state for an exercise (for mentor reference or self-checking).
-   `ChallengeName.pkt`: A scenario designed as a standalone challenge (e.g., troubleshooting, security hardening).
-   `Demo_Topic.pkt`: A file used to demonstrate a specific concept or configuration.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer installed (available free from Cisco Networking Academy).
2.  Download the required `.pkt` file.
3.  Open the file in Packet Tracer.
4.  Follow the instructions provided either within the Packet Tracer scenario (e.g., using the activity wizard or notes) or in a corresponding exercise file in `../Exercises/`.

## Contribution

-   Create new, unique `.pkt` scenarios relevant to CyberPatriot tasks (hardening, ACLs, basic routing, switch security, troubleshooting).
-   Ensure scenarios are solvable and test the intended concepts.
-   Provide clear instructions or objectives, either within the `.pkt` file or in a companion `.md` file.
-   Consider creating both starting and solution versions.
-   Submit contributions via pull request.
