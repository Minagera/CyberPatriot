# Cisco IOS Configuration Scripts & Snippets

This directory contains examples and templates of Cisco IOS configuration commands, grouped logically to represent common tasks encountered in CyberPatriot. These are **not** executable scripts but rather reference snippets.

## Purpose

-   Provide quick reference for blocks of commands needed for specific configurations (e.g., basic hardening, SSH setup, ACL structure).
-   Help cadets understand the sequence and context of related commands.
-   Serve as templates that can be adapted during competition (copy-paste into a text editor, modify, then paste into the CLI).

## Example Snippets (Illustrative)

-   `basic_hardening.txt`: Hostname, enable secret, console/VTY passwords, MOTD banner, service password-encryption.
-   `ssh_setup.txt`: Domain name, crypto key generation, local user, VTY lines configured for SSH.
-   `standard_acl_example.txt`: Syntax for defining and applying a standard ACL.
-   `extended_acl_example.txt`: Syntax for defining and applying an extended ACL (e.g., allowing specific web traffic).
-   `port_security_basic.txt`: Basic port security configuration commands.

## How to Use

-   Review the snippets to understand the commands involved in common tasks.
-   During practice or competition, copy relevant snippets to a text editor.
-   **Carefully modify** parameters (passwords, IP addresses, interface names, ACL numbers/names) to match the specific scenario requirements.
-   Paste the modified commands into the appropriate configuration mode in the Cisco device CLI (within Packet Tracer or on real hardware).
-   **Always verify** the configuration using `show run` and test connectivity/functionality.

## Contribution

-   Add new, unique snippets for other common CyberPatriot Cisco tasks.
-   Ensure snippets are well-commented (# or !) explaining the purpose of command blocks.
-   Keep snippets focused and modular.
-   Submit contributions via pull request.
