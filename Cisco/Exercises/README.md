# Cisco Networking Exercises for CyberPatriot

This directory provides unique, hands-on exercises focused on Cisco IOS configuration and troubleshooting, designed to be completed using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Exercise Types

-   **CLI Command Practice:** Focused drills on specific IOS commands or configuration sequences (e.g., configuring SSH, setting up port security).
-   **Configuration Tasks:** Scenarios requiring cadets to configure devices according to specific requirements (e.g., implement ACLs, configure basic routing). Often uses `.pkt` files from `../PacketTracer/` as starting points.
-   **Troubleshooting Challenges:** Scenarios with pre-configured networks containing errors that cadets must diagnose and fix using `show` commands, `ping`, and `traceroute`.

## How to Use

-   Download Cisco Packet Tracer if you haven't already.
-   Open the relevant `.pkt` file from `../PacketTracer/` if the exercise requires it.
-   Follow the instructions within the exercise description (which might be in a separate `.md` file or embedded in the Packet Tracer scenario).
-   Use the commands learned in the `../Guides/` to complete the tasks.
-   Save your work frequently within Packet Tracer.
-   Document your key configuration steps or troubleshooting findings.
