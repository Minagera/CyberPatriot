# CyberPatriot Program Sponsorship Resources

This directory contains unique templates and information related to seeking sponsorship and support, specifically tailored for the Grissom High School JROTC CyberPatriot program (but adaptable for others). Securing resources is vital for providing cadets with the necessary tools (laptops, software, competition fees, travel funds) to succeed.

## Resource Index

-   [**Program_Brochure_Template.md**](Program_Brochure_Template.md)
    *   A customizable template for a concise, visually appealing brochure outlining the program's mission, impact, needs, and sponsorship opportunities. Suitable for outreach events or mailing.
-   [**Dell-Support-Request.md**](Dell-Support-Request.md)
    *   A specific example letter template tailored for requesting support (e.g., hardware donations) from Dell Technologies, referencing past challenges and program goals. Adaptable for other specific corporate targets.
-   [**Corporate-Support-Options.md**](Corporate-Support-Options.md)
    *   A document outlining various types of corporate support (financial, in-kind donations, mentorship, grants) and listing potential local (Huntsville area) and national organizations relevant to STEM/cybersecurity education. Includes links and brief descriptions.
-   [**Generic_Sponsorship_Letter_Template.md**](Generic_Sponsorship_Letter_Template.md) (New Placeholder)

*(Note: Ensure these placeholder template files exist or are created.)*

## How to Use

-   **Adapt Templates:** Customize the templates (`.md` files) with specific details about the current Grissom JROTC CyberPatriot team, recent achievements, specific funding/equipment needs for the upcoming season (e.g., "Need 5 new laptops for training", "Seeking funds for National Finals travel").
-   **Identify Targets:** Use the `Corporate-Support-Options.md` document to brainstorm potential local and national sponsors. Research companies with local presence, STEM outreach programs, or ties to defense/cybersecurity.
-   **Tailor Requests:** Modify the generic letter or use the Dell example as a base to create targeted requests for specific companies. Highlight alignment between the company's interests and the CyberPatriot program's goals (e.g., workforce development, STEM education).
-   **Outreach Materials:** Use the brochure template to create professional-looking handouts for meetings or events.
-   **Follow Up:** Track outreach efforts and follow up politely with potential sponsors.

## Contribution

-   Add information about successful sponsorship strategies or contacts relevant to the Grissom program or Huntsville area.
-   Update templates with more compelling language, statistics about program impact, or current needs.
-   Research and add details about other potential corporate sponsors, grant programs (local, state, federal), or foundations supporting STEM/cybersecurity education, especially those with ties to Alabama or JROTC. Ensure uniqueness and relevance.
