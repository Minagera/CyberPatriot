# CyberPatriot Team Resources

This directory contains unique guides, templates, and protocols focused on the 'soft skills' and organizational aspects crucial for CyberPatriot team success. Effective strategy, workflow, role definition, and communication are just as important as technical skills, especially under competition pressure.

## Resource Index

-   [**Competition_Strategy_Guide.md**](Competition_Strategy_Guide.md)
    *   Outlines key strategic elements: defining team roles, establishing workflow phases (Read README -> Recon -> Remediate -> Verify), communication tips, and unique approaches for success. Emphasizes baselining, prioritization based on the README, and documentation.
-   [**incident_response_workflow.md**](incident_response_workflow.md)
    *   A simplified, actionable step-by-step workflow for tackling a competition image, emphasizing reading the README first and following a structured approach (e.g., Users -> Persistence -> Services -> Policies -> Forensics -> Verify). Complements the strategy guide.
-   [**communication_protocols.md**](communication_protocols.md)
    *   Defines structured communication methods like SITREP (Situation Report - regular updates on points, tasks, blockers) and BLOCKER (protocol for efficiently asking for help when stuck) for use during competition to maintain situational awareness and resolve issues quickly.
-   [**team_formation.md**](team_formation.md)
    *   Guidelines for structuring a team, assigning primary/backup roles based on strengths (Windows, Linux, Cisco, Docs/Forensics, Orchestrator/Captain), and the importance of cross-training for resilience.
-   [**practice_schedule.md**](practice_schedule.md)
    *   A template for organizing weekly and monthly team practice sessions, suggesting focus areas (curriculum topics, platform deep dives, mock competitions) and simulation types.
-   [**debrief_template.md**](debrief_template.md) (New Placeholder)
    *   A template to guide post-practice or post-competition debrief sessions, focusing on lessons learned, successes, challenges, and action items for improvement.

*(Note: Ensure these placeholder markdown files exist or are created.)*

## How to Use

-   Review these guides as a team during pre-season training and periodically throughout the season, especially before major competition rounds.
-   Discuss and adapt the strategies, roles, and protocols to fit your team's specific members, strengths, and style. Agree on how you will operate *before* the competition starts.
-   Use the workflow guides to structure your approach during practice sessions and actual competitions.
-   Refer to the role definitions when assigning tasks and responsibilities.
-   **Practice** using the communication protocols (SITREP, BLOCKER) during mock competitions so they become second nature.
-   Use the debrief template after practice sessions to foster continuous improvement.
