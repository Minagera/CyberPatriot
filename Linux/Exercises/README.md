# Linux Security Exercises for CyberPatriot

This directory provides unique, hands-on exercises specifically designed to reinforce Linux security concepts and incident response skills using the command line for CyberPatriot.

## Exercise Types

-   **CLI Drills:** Focused tasks on specific commands or techniques (e.g., finding files with `find`, managing services with `systemctl`, setting permissions with `chmod`).
-   **Mini-Scenarios:** Small-scale challenges involving a few related vulnerabilities or forensic questions on a Linux system.
-   **Incident Response Challenges:** More complex exercises simulating aspects of a compromised Linux server, potentially requiring use of VM snapshots created via `../../VM-Setup/Linux/`.

## How to Use

-   Work through exercises corresponding to the topics covered in the `../Guides/` and the main `../../Curriculum/`.
-   Document your commands and findings as you would in a competition. Use text files or the templates in `../../Resources/Templates/`.
-   Refer to `../Guides/` and `../../Resources/References/` if you get stuck, but try to solve problems independently first.
-   Solutions or mentor notes may be provided for some exercises (check specific exercise files or a potential `Solutions/` subdirectory).
