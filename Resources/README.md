# CyberPatriot Resources

This directory contains unique, reusable resources, templates, reference materials, and core principle guides designed to support CyberPatriot training and competition activities.

## Directory Structure

-   [**Templates/**](Templates/README.md)
    *   Standardized document templates for use during competition and practice (e.g., Change Log, Incident Response Report, Forensics Answer Sheet, Team Workflow Checklist). Using templates promotes consistency and efficiency under pressure.
-   [**References/**](References/README.md)
    *   Quick reference sheets ("cheat sheets") summarizing common commands, file paths, tools, and configuration snippets for Windows, Linux, and Cisco IOS. Designed for fast lookups during competition.
-   [**Tools/**](Tools/README.md)
    *   Placeholder for potential future unique scripts or utilities designed to aid in training or analysis (e.g., simple baseline report generators, log analysis helpers). Distinct from platform-specific audit/setup scripts found elsewhere.
-   [**Core_Security_Principles.md**](Core_Security_Principles.md)
    *   A unique guide explaining fundamental cybersecurity concepts (CIA Triad, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, etc.) and their practical application within the CyberPatriot competition context. Understanding these helps justify security decisions.

## How to Use These Resources

1.  **Templates:** Familiarize yourself with the templates *before* competitions. Practice using them during training exercises to become efficient at documentation. Adapt them slightly if needed for team workflow, but maintain core information.
2.  **References:** Keep reference sheets handy (digitally or printed) during practice and competition for quick lookups. Don't rely on them exclusively; strive to internalize common commands.
3.  **Core Principles:** Read and understand the `Core_Security_Principles.md` guide. Apply these principles when making decisions about hardening and remediation. Be prepared to explain *why* a change improves security based on these concepts.
4.  **Contribute:** Suggest improvements or additions to templates and reference sheets. Propose ideas for useful tools. Ensure all contributions are unique and tailored for CyberPatriot.

## Example Resources

-   Change Log Template ([Templates/Change_Log_Template.md](Templates/Change_Log_Template.md))
-   Windows Command Reference ([References/Windows_Security_Reference.md](References/Windows_Security_Reference.md))
-   Linux Command Reference ([References/Linux_Security_Reference.md](References/Linux_Security_Reference.md))
-   Cisco Command Reference ([References/Cisco_IOS_Reference.md](References/Cisco_IOS_Reference.md))
-   Core Security Principles Guide ([Core_Security_Principles.md](Core_Security_Principles.md))

## Contribution Guidelines

-   All resources must be original or clearly attributed if based on external concepts, and significantly tailored for unique CyberPatriot use.
-   Clearly document the purpose and usage of each file, especially for templates and tools.
-   Submit improvements or new resources via pull request. Ensure uniqueness and relevance to CyberPatriot tasks.
