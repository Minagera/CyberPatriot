# CyberPatriot Support Tools (Placeholder)

This directory is a placeholder for potential future unique tools, scripts, or utilities designed to support CyberPatriot training, analysis, or specific competition-related tasks.

**Distinction:** Tools in this directory are intended to be more general or meta-level compared to the platform-specific audit/reconnaissance scripts found in `../Windows/Scripts/` or `../Linux/Scripts/`. They might assist with workflow, analysis, or practice environment management.

## Potential Future Tools (Ideas)

-   **Baseline Report Generator:** A script (e.g., Python) that could potentially run platform-specific audit scripts and compile their output into a structured baseline report (HTML, Markdown).
-   **Log Analysis Helper:** Simple scripts or guides on using tools (like `grep`, `awk`, potentially LogParser) to quickly filter or summarize large log files based on common CyberPatriot forensic needs.
-   **Checklist Tracker:** A simple web app or script to digitally track progress through the checklists in `../../Checklists/`.
-   **Scenario Element Randomizer:** Concepts or simple scripts to help instructors vary elements within the `../../VM-Setup/` scenarios (e.g., suggest different usernames, ports, or persistence locations).

## Current Status

Currently, this directory is a placeholder. No tools are implemented yet.

## Contribution

If you develop a unique tool that fits the description above and could genuinely aid CyberPatriot teams in training or (rule-permissible) competition tasks, please consider contributing.
-   Ensure the tool is original and specifically tailored for CyberPatriot context.
-   Provide clear documentation on its purpose, usage, and limitations.
-   Ensure the tool complies with all CyberPatriot competition rules regarding external assistance.
-   Submit via pull request with thorough explanation and testing.
