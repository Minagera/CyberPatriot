## How to Use

1.  **Familiarize:** Review these templates *before* competition day. Understand what information needs to be recorded.
2.  **Adapt (Slightly):** Teams can make minor adjustments to fit their workflow, but keep the core elements.
3.  **Assign Roles:** Designate who is primarily responsible for maintaining the Change Log and Forensics Answers (e.g., Documentation Lead).
4.  **Use Consistently:** Make documentation a habit during every practice session.
5.  **Store Centrally:** Use a shared document or method accessible to the team during competition (e.g., shared text file, Google Doc - check competition rules on external tools).
